What this application accomplishes: 
It replicated the functionality of a specific ball clock, located here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MmlViYNUC0
The valid input for this ball clock is 27 balls up to 127 balls. Given any amount of valid inputs, this application calculates
how long it takes for the natural ordering of those balls to go through the ball clock, and results BACK to, its natural ordering. (Some valid inputs take over 250 years!)

To run this code:

1) compile all files, using: javac *.java in the command line
2) Push the all_clocks_input txt file into the program using: java Test < all_clocks_input

The resulting output should be a direct replica of all_clocks_output.txt
